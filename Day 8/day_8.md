#### Day 8 - 17-09-2024

#### **üìñ Concepts of Heap and Trie**

### Heap
A Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is commonly used to implement priority queues. In a max-heap, for any given node, the value of that node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. In a min-heap, the value of the node is less than or equal to the values of its children.

#### üîç Real-time Example
Using a heap to efficiently get the k largest elements from an array.

### Trie
A Trie (or prefix tree) is a specialized tree used to store dynamic sets of strings where the keys are usually strings. It allows for fast retrieval of strings and is commonly used for tasks involving prefix matching or dictionary-based searching.

#### üîç Real-time Example
Using a Trie to implement autocomplete functionality.

#### **‚ú® Advantages of Heap and Trie**

- **_Heap_**:
  - Allows for efficient priority queue operations.
  - Provides logarithmic time complexity for insertion and deletion.
- **_Trie_**:
  - Efficiently supports prefix-based searching and insertion.
  - Optimized for operations on strings such as autocomplete.

#### **üåü Use Cases**

- **_Heap_**:
  - Implementing priority queues.
  - Finding the k smallest or largest elements in an array.
- **_Trie_**:
  - Autocomplete and spell checking.
  - Longest common prefix problem.

**_Top K Frequent Elements_**

Given an array of integers and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may assume that the answer is unique.

**_Constraints_**:

- 1 ‚â§ `nums.length` ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ `k` ‚â§ `nums.length`

**_Examples_**:

**_Example 1_**:

```java
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: The two most frequent elements are 1 and 2.
```

**_Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)_**

Implement a Trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods. Trie should be able to store words and support efficient prefix-based queries.

**_Constraints_**:

- 1 ‚â§ `word.length` ‚â§ 2000
- 1 ‚â§ `prefix.length` ‚â§ 2000

**_Examples_**:

**_Example 1_**:

```java
Input: insert("apple"), search("apple"), search("app"), startsWith("app"), insert("app"), search("app")
Output: [true, true, false, true, true]
Explanation: Words and prefixes are inserted and queried efficiently.
```

#### **‚ùì Practice Problems**

1. **_Top K Frequent Elements_**:
   - **_Objective_**: Find the top k most frequent elements using a heap-based approach.
   - **_Key Concept_**: Use a max-heap to track the k most frequent elements.

2. **_Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)_**:
   - **_Objective_**: Implement a Trie data structure and its operations.
   - **_Key Concept_**: Use Trie to store and retrieve words with efficient prefix-based searches.
