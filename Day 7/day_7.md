#### Day 7 - 16-09-2024

#### **üìñ Concepts of Greedy Algorithms and Graph Traversal**

### Greedy Algorithms
Greedy Algorithms build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. The greedy choice is made with the hope that this local optimization will lead to a global optimum. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems where a series of local optimal choices lead to a global solution.

#### üîç Real-time Example
Using a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of coins needed for a given amount.

### Graph Traversal
Graph Traversal refers to techniques for visiting all the nodes in a graph systematically. Common traversal methods include Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). These methods are used to explore nodes and edges of a graph and are foundational for many graph-related algorithms.

#### üîç Real-time Example
Using BFS to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

**_Activity Selection_**

Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.

**_Constraints_**:

- 1 ‚â§ `n` ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- Activities are given with their start and end times.

**_Examples_**:

**_Example 1_**:

```java
Input: activities = [[1, 4], [2, 6], [5, 7], [8, 9]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Select activities [1, 4], [5, 7], and [8, 9] for maximum count without overlap.
```

**_Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph_**

Given an unweighted graph and a starting node, find the shortest path to all other nodes using BFS.

**_Constraints_**:

- 1 ‚â§ `nodes` ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- Graph is represented using an adjacency list.

**_Examples_**:

**_Example 1_**:

```java
Input: graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: []}, start = 0
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2]
Explanation: Shortest paths from node 0 are [0, 1, 1, 2] to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
```

#### **‚ùì Practice Problems**

1. **_Activity Selection_**:
   - **_Objective_**: Select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities using a greedy approach.
   - **_Key Concept_**: Use greedy choice to select the earliest finishing activity that is compatible with the previously selected activities.

2. **_Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph_**:
   - **_Objective_**: Find the shortest path in an unweighted graph using BFS.
   - **_Key Concept_**: Use BFS to explore nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.
